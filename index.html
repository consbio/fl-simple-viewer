                                            You’ll find information on priority natural resources, biodiversity richness,
                                            landscape connectivity and integrity, surface waters and factors
                                            contributing to potential landscape change (sea level rise, urban development).

The CLIP version has been re-prioritized to reflect more general conservation needs for rare species. FNAI modeled suitable habitat around documented locations for 281 species of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, including aquatic species.  Highest priorities could indicate a single species with very high conservation need, or multiple species with high conservation need.

The CLIP version also identifies habitat on conservation lands for all 62 species analyzed for the project.

The natural communities were mapped primarily based on the FNAI/FWC Cooperative Land Cover (CLC) data layer.  This layer includes 12 priority natural community types: upland glades, pine rocklands, seepage slopes, scrub, sandhill, sandhill upland lakes, rockland hammock, coastal uplands, imperiled coastal lakes, dry prairie, upland pine, pine flatwoods, upland hardwood forest, or coastal wetlands. These natural communities are prioritized by a combination of their heritage global status rank (G-rank) and landscape context, based on the Land Use Intensity Index (subset of CLIP Landscape Integrity Index) and FNAI Potential Natural Areas.

A more specific description of these prioritization can be found in Appendix D of the CLIP Technical Report.

Higher values indicate large expanses of remote, intact natural and semi-natural areas.  Lower values indicate more fragmented landscapes with increasingly intensive land uses from agriculture to urban development.

                                                        This data layer was created by FNAI, in consultation with water resource experts, originally to inform the Florida Forever environmental land acquisition program. Wetlands were mapped based on the Cooperative Land Cover (CLC) data layer. Highest priorities indicate wetlands within large intact natural landscapes (although the wetlands themselves may be small or large). Lowest priorities indicate wetlands within fragmented landscapes surrounded by intensive agriculture or urban development

                                                        This data layer was created by FNAI, in collaboration with Advanced Geospatial, Inc., originally to inform the Florida Forever environmental land acquisition program. AGI developed an initial Recharge Potential model following a similar model to the Florida Aquifer Vulnerability Assessment (FAVA). FNAI removed discharge areas and prioritized the model based on overlap with Springs Protection Areas and buffers to public water supply wells. High priorities indicate high potential for recharge to an underlying aquifer system. The highest priorities indicate high potential for recharge to springs or public water supplies.

                                            <p>
                                                These sea level rise projections were produced by the University of Florida Geoplan Center.
                                                These projections measure sea level rise in meter increments up until 3 meters, based on Bathtub sea level rise models.
                                                The graph below reports the area affected for each of these three scenarios (as well as the area unaffected).
                                                Time ranges were extrapolated from the High Bathtub Projections (for Mean Sea Level Rise) used in the University of
                                                Florida GeoPlan Center’s <a href="http://sls.geoplan.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Sea Level Rise Sketch tool</a>.
                                                The hectares reported for each of these scenarios are cumulative figures.

                                            <p>
                                                These development projections are derived from the Florida 2060 development dataset. This projections explores the physical reality and consequences of the population growth from 2005 to 2060 if existing land use policy or population growth patterns do not change.  The land use suitability analysis displayed in this dataset was performed by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center for 1000 Friends of Florida. The graph below reports the area affected for each of the three time steps used in this model, the existing extent of urbanization in 2005, and the area unaffected by urbanization. The hectares reported for each of the three time steps are cumulative figures.

                                                    Conservation priorities and potential areas of interest for partner
                                                    organizations and land trusts. Each partner prioritizes conservation
                                                    need differently and so these identified areas are not entirely comparable.
                                                    Nevertheless, an attempt was made to standardize the summarization of
                                                    these differing efforts. To start, a prioritization was only associated
                                                    with a HUC12 if it occupied a significant portion of that HUC
                                                    (greater than a third). In terms of prioritizations, if an organization
                                                    ranked its priorities, only better than average/normal priority
                                                    areas were included. For instance, for the National Bobwhite
                                                    Conservation Initiative, only High and Moderate rankings were included.
                                                    Or, for the Nature Conservancy Resilient Sites, any above average
                                                    resiliency area was included (Slightly Above Average, Above Average, and Far Above Average).
                                                    For other prioritizations, the results were binary such as the Nature
                                                    Conservancy’s Ecoregional Priorities where all areas designated as
                                                    priorities or linkages were included. More information about these
